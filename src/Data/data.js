      text:
        'It all started 2017 when Caroline fell in love with Jens and decided to go live with him in an art collective where he lived at in the high-jungles of Peru. Pretty quickly we happily got married, and we discovered that we could make beautiful art <br />TOGETHER.<br /> After living in the art collective for some time we decided to go on a mythic adventure just the two of us. This story starts in Peru with a mural we painted together for fun in a hostel. It made way for many more murals to come during our travels through Peru, Ecuador and Colombia and finally Sweden.  <br /><br />Love/ Mr and Mrs THOR',

      text:
        'Joyce is a happy native Shipibo girl from the jungle of Peru, she is immersed in the old ancient icaro patterns that are sung by the initiated during ayahuasca ceremonies. We felt inspired by the natives of Peru and their traditions from living there amongst them for years ourselves. The icaros are the healing songs of the ayahuasceros, they use them to direct the energies during ayahuasca ceremony',

        'Meet the sea turtles Rosa and Charlie! They swim right outside the hotel in the pacific ocean. The turtle is an ancient animal and it’s totem contains a lot of wisdom, such as; persistence, endurance and longevity. Just keep moving towards your goals no matter how slow or difficult the process may get. The names for the turtles is also the names of the staff working at the hotel we were painting.',

      text:
        'Imagine this... The cheeky parrot just told the most hilarious joke to the man and then turns around proudly to us as to say -"How funny was that?" We used the shipibo pattern again, this time with sunset colours and golden yellow over the mans face. The flowers are Lily of the Incas. We simply felt inspired to do a "laugh out loud" kind of painting and put together this. The same day we decided to paint the blue macaw was the same day the news later that day announced it was extinct. Conincident?',

      text:
        'With the jaguar, toucan, roses and patterns we wanted to capture the Ecuadorian spirit here in Mompiche. The local toucan symbolizes showmanship, self esteem, and revealing the true inner self. With his colorful appearance and large bill he show us the desire to be seen and heard. The Jaguar symbolizes strength, confidence, focus, and is sleek and astoundingly powerful. The rose is the national flower of Ecuador, and the red rose symbolizes love and desire. In the background we painted a native pattern with the colors of their flag. To give it a true totem feeling we added two colorful feathers.',

        'This is a woman with traditional features from one of the few intact tribes left in Colombia, the Wayuu. The Wayuu´s are a matriarchal tribe where all shamans and politicians are women. They are deeply spiritual and connected to nature, worshiping the rain and the Oneness of life. We were very inspired by their face paintings and the artwork they do and wanted to give tribute to that buy painting patterns and fine details in the straw hat and earings.',

        'This is a local Cartagena city girl named Leyna. We wanted to capture a modern image of Cartagena and picked our favourite waitress at our favourite restaurant in Cartagena to model for us. Cartagena is filled with colourful birds and as we would have morning coffee on the rooftop at our hotel we got inspired by all the birds sitting in the mango tree above us. We added a lush Caribbean background with banana leaves and two lovebirds sitting on her finger. Across the leaves we added a layer of a typical precolombian pattern to connect the native heritage.',

      text:
        'Being back in Sweden we strongly felt a connection to Nordic mythology. Tovner is one of the lynxes that drags goddess Frejas carriage. The lynx is a power animal symbolizing clarity, wisdom and magic. The sunset highlights the forest full of heather flower. The forest is a primal symbol of life and wealth, a place that contains many mysteries and lessons about ourselves. Then we merged in the Yggdrasil pattern, the Nordic tree of life. Yggdrasil is the framework of the Universe, it holds together all dimensions and worlds and represents lifes cycles of birth, growth, death and rebirth.',

      text:
        '"Freja`s falcon harbour" also comes from the Nordic mythology, it is a spiritual feather coat that magically transforms the one who wears it into a falcon. The falcon symbolizes wisdom, vision and protection. We choose to add roses to this painting because of their powerful meaning. The peach-colored roses stand for honesty and gratitude. The pattern in the foreground is a pole vault, it is used as protection against various kinds of obstacles that can cause a person to loose their path.',
